# My Journey Begins

## About
An introduction of an exploration of a new planet told in first person. 

## Artist Statement
My goal in this project was to convey a quirky, whimsical and adventurous mood in the reader that was very random. I achieved this by having each nonterminal symbol have many different possible combinations and states that were long and descriptive. I only had time to appeal to visual imagery, so I defined intricate visual components that could be reused over and over.

Additionally, to improve the imagery, I used fragments in a sing-songy way. One feature I needed to nail down was the comma placement, esp. for the list. I used a technique I learned from CSE110A to recurse the selection to create long lists.

Finally, I made the descriptions of the organism weird. Some of them don't make sense (and may have English syntax errors, but I kept them because it makes the organism seem more exotic).
